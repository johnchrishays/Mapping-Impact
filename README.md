# Mapping-Impact
a data visualization project created for a community foundation in Minneapolis

Description:

How to use it.

Marker. Each marker represents a Headwaters grantee. The highlighted area represents the geographic area that they serve.
a marker clusterer Marker Clusters. These icons signify that there are multiple map markers in a tight geographical area. The number in the center tells how many markers are in the cluster. If you click on the cluster, the map will automatically zoom to display the markers in more detail.

Feel free to explore the markers and the list of grantees to the right. If you hover or click a marker or a grantee name, an information box will appear on the far right describing the work that the organization does, their address, and details about the grants they have received. Just click on a selected marker to unselect it.

If you select Click to see Organizations led by People of Color, the map will update to show the approximately 80 organizations that are led by People of Color. Headwaters considers organizations to be led by and for communities of color if at least 51% of a groupâ€™s board of directors, senior leadership, and staff identify as people of color and reflect its constituency base.

If you select Reset View, the map will zoom out to include all of Minnesota.
 
Note: Not all of our data is complete. If there is no highlighted area associated with a marker, we may not have access to detailed information about the geographic area where they serve. Let us know if you want to update your information or you think you found an inaccuracy!

Our purpose.

We want to show you a snapshot of the work that our grantees have done and how we have worked to support them. Our goal was to place our grantees geographically within the communities they serve and show the diversity of organizations working from statewide to neighborhood-level.

How it was conceived. This project emerged out of the foundation's Listening Tour of 2016. This tool is about telling the stories of the important work our grantees do and raising awareness about their impact across the state.

Intended Audiences. We want our grantees to feel heard. As a donor, organizer, or volunteer, we want you to be able to recognize and connect with organizations, whether they work in your neighborhood or are fighting for issues you care about in another part of the state.
How we did it.

Using a variety of data collection methods, we gathered geographic, demographic and grant-related information about the organizations we support. We collected data from our own records, from interactive activities at our events, and from online surveys. Here are some of the key characteristics of our methodology:

Updatable. The map will continue to serve as a snapshot of our grantees over time. We included all organizations that have received grants since the beginning of 2015.

Self-reported. While we tried to avoid burdening our grantees with an overload of surveys and requests, we value the importance of organizations self-identifying important aspects of their scope and mission. We think it is important for the organizations themselves to report the geographic area of their constituency. We created an interactive activity at the 2017 Grantee Convening for the organizations to report that information and start a conversation with other grantees.
